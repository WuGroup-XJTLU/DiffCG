# A jax-based modular package for differentiable coarse-graining

## Overview
DiffCG supports two general coarse-graining methods: top-down and bottom-up approaches.

The top-down methods include the iterative Boltzmann Inversion, Differentiable Molecular Dynamics.

The bottom-up methods include the Force-Matching and Relative Entropy.
